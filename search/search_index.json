The main issue with vanilla Anki is the \"ease problem\" discussed in here. The problem arises when one misses a card repeatedly which lowers the ease factor on that card. Concretely, this means that you will see the card more and more. On vanilla Anki, the only way to push the ease factor back up is to press \"Easy\". But it is not clear why this distinction is meaningful, and it is not clear either what \"Hard\", \"Good\" or \"Easy\" represent when learning a language. We are going to sidestep the problem entirely by changing the way Anki deals with ease. To do this, we are going to use a few different add-ons.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#general-add-ons","title":"General Add-ons","text":"<p>These add-ons are useful for everyone and every deck.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#advanced-browser","title":"Advanced Browser","text":"<p>As the name implies, this gives the browser featured more functionalities.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#advanced-copy-fields","title":"Advanced Copy Fields","text":"<p>Lets you replace and copy things from your Anki fields.
