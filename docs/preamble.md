## 1.1 Why do people fail to learn a language?

Every New Years, millions of people set a resolution to learn a new language. They start with enthusiasm&mdash;signing up for language apps, buying textbooks, and proudly committing to their thousand-day Duolingo streaks. Yet, many fail to reach a high proficiency even after years of study.

Why is this the case? Might their methods be fundamentally flawed, or is language learning simply just too hard?

In my opinion, there is no outright good or bad method. While there is such a thing as a best method for an individual, that doesn't mean it's best for everyone. 

Some people love textbooks, others find their flow with anime or movies, and some swear by language tutors. What works for one may not always work for another. 

In this guide I will focus on immersion, a method that worked exceptionally well for me and many others.
However, that doesn’t mean you need to follow every suggestion here to the letter. I don’t strictly adhere to everything I mention in this guide, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to either. Instead, experiment, adapt, and tailor the approach to suit your personal preferences. Every method contributes, the only difference is which sides you develop and how quickly[^1].

[^1]: Duolingo is an exception. In the next parts, you learn that it is dangerous to mix in extrinsic motivators to your already intrinsic motivation. Duolingo is built on badges, streaks and gamification. To keep users engaged, it has to put out easy, effortless content to sustain a sense of mastery.  However, these "bite-sized lessons" contribute little to actual language acquisition. True learning requires effort—there are no shortcuts.

**The real root of the issue, I believe, lies in their mindset.**

 When you find genuine enjoyment in reading and listening to native content, it becomes something you look forward to, making you naturally want to continue the next day. 
 
 This is a simple but often overlooked idea.
 
 It’s easy to feel stumped, frustrated, convinced that you aren’t making enough progress, especially when you’re focused solely on hitting specific milestones. The pressure to reach a certain level can make the process feel like a grind, but when you shift your focus to enjoying the journey&mdash;whether it’s laughing at a funny joke you didn’t understand before, learning a new slang, talking like a retainer in medieval China, or simply being immersed in a language you love&mdash;it becomes far more rewarding. These small moments are ultimately what makes your journey an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

Textbooks and tutors are all valid ways of learning, but they shouldn't be what you solely rely on&mdash;at the end of the day, they can only teach you a very small subset of the language and it’s your job to go and explore the rest on your own. In this guide, I will help you find the joy of language learning through immersing in content you love and achieve that New Year’s resolution.

## 1.2 How to stay motivated when learning?

Learning a language is a huge commitment. 

You may often consciously or unconsciously set ambitions for yourself&mdash;be it achieving in 6 months, climbing to the highest rank on a Discord server, or surpassing someone who started at the same time as you. While these goals are undoubtedly common, they are often unsustainable. Language learning doesn’t follow a straight path; progress is gradual, sometimes imperceptible, and at times, it may even feel like you’re moving backwards.

In an attempt to stay on track, many people turn to paid classes or language apps, believing that a financial commitment will create an obligation to study. However, this external pressure may be hindering their progress rather than helping[^2]. When learning starts to feel like a chore, motivation tends to fade, making it even harder to stay consistent in the long run[^3].

[^2]: This is why I believe most people from the immersion community perceive textbook and tutors as being the wrong method.

[^3]: This phenomenon is known as motivation crowding which has been extensively studied in psychology and economics. The papers [A Fine is a Price](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/468061?seq=1) and [Pay Enough or Don't Pay at All](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586896?seq=1) describe the effect in great detail.

***“So how do I stay consistent?”*** you might ask.

The key is to shift your focus from goals to actions. 

Instead of aiming to finish a book in a month, commit to reading 20 lines a day. Don’t worry about the 20 lines you have to read tomorrow, just focus on the 20 lines of today.

This mindset turns immersion into a routine, into something you do naturally everyday without too much thought. In time, you will be able to enjoy the book rather than stressing over the pages ahead.

The same applies to Anki. Over time, reviewing flashcards may get tedious. But with a proper routine in place, you’ll be able to push through&mdash;just as when faced with a door you have to go through, you don't pause to deliberate; you simply open the door[^4].

[^4]: This process is often dubbed the Jsph way after a prominent person in the Japanese immersion community and personal friend.

There will be times when you feel like you're hardly making any progress. When this happens, take a moment to reflect on how far you’ve come. Think about where you were a few weeks ago, a couple of months ago, even years ago. It’s easy to feel stuck in the moment, but when you pause and look back, you’ll find that you've come much further than you realize.

## 1.3 Language is hard

**Your first reading material will suck.** 

You will spend a lot of time deciphering basic grammar patterns, and every sentence you encounter will have one or multiple new words. This is perfectly normal. The more you read, the easier it becomes.

The same goes for listening. The first time you sit down in front of a drama episode, it will likely feel chaotic. People speak fast, and you may struggle to make out individual words let alone full sentences. But as you continue to immerse, comprehension will grow.

In immersion learning, oftentimes you must come to terms with not understand everything&mdash;and that’s okay. Language is vast, and mastering it takes time. But remember, everything will get better.

Once you finish your first book, the next one will feel incredibly easier.

Within as few as five books, you will find yourself confidently past the beginner stage.

The early stages of immersion will be an uphill battle, but you must *trust the process*.

Knowing this, you've won half the battle.

I hope you're hooked on immersion learning by now. Without further ado, let's dive in.
