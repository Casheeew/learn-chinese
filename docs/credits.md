# Credits
I would like to thank several people in the Japanese learning community, where I spend most of my time. First and foremost, Iâ€™d like to thank Kuri, as much of this guide is based on their [Learn Japanese guide](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/).

I would also like to give special thanks to Cindsa for dedicating their time to help me write parts of this guide.
