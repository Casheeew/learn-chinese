# Guide

Below is a simple roadmap for learning Chinese effectively. Each step, I explain what you should focus on to progress to the next stage. 

All the steps outlined work towards immersion. While this will be the final and longest step of your journey, it should be most fun as you will be using Chinese to consume the media you love.

## 1 The beginnings

### 1.1 Learning the sounds

!!! note "Pinyin vs. Zhuyin"
    If you are learning Taiwanese Mandarin, you might be looking to learn Zhuyin instead. However, since Pinyin is more common, this material will only cover it. If you're curious about the differences between Pinyin and Zhuyin, [see the addendum below](#pinyin-vs-zhuyin).

The very first thing you should do is to learn Pinyin. Pinyin is a system used for spelling out Chinese sounds which uses the letters of the English alphabet that you are already familiar with. Practice by shadowing this Pinyin chart[^1].

[^1]: If you are a linguistics student or otherwise can read the IPA, you may also find following the [Standard Chinese phonology wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology) to be helpful when learning the sounds of Mandarin.

#### Quick tips

- The letter *ū* is written as *u* when following *j*, *q*, *x*, or *y*.
- The finals *ui*, *un*, and *iu* are contractions of *uei*, *uen*, and *iou* respectively. They pronounce the exact same.
- *i* represents three distinct sounds depending on the initial that precedes it. When it follows *z*, *c*, *s*, it sounds like **zz**. When it follows *zh*, *ch*, *sh*, and *r*, it sounds like **rr**. In other cases, it sounds like the English **ee**.
- The *an* in *'tian'* and *yuan* sounds like the English **yen**.

A good alternative that I highly recommend is following the [Chinese Pronunciation Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Main_Page). It is a really good resource that I personally used, and I suggest going through all the articles at least once.

### 1.2 Drill the tones

Mandarin is a **tonal language**. This means that the **tone**—the rise and fall of your pitch during pronunciation of a syllable—can completely change the word's meaning.

There are 4 main tones in Mandarin, plus a neutral tone:

1. First tone – High and flat (e.g., 妈 *mā* – "mother")
2. Second tone – Rising, like asking a question in English (e.g., 麻 *má* – "hemp")
3. Third tone – Dips down and then rises (e.g., 马 *mǎ* – "horse")
4. Fourth tone – Falling (e.g., 骂 *mà* – "scold")
5. Neutral tone – Light and unstressed (e.g., 吗 *ma* – a grammatical particle for questions)

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MkRL33bIc8&t=6s) for a quick demonstration of tones. Be sure to read [this article](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Four_tones) for a really good explanation of tones.

##### Are tones optional?

No, tones are not optional. You must to learn them to understand Mandarin speech. Tones are a fundamental feature of the language. Sometimes, you may hear claims such as "even if you speak tones incorrectly, people will still understand from context". While this is occasionally true, many other times you will just not be understood.

##### Practice

- **Learn** the tones through [this excellent video from Grace Mandarin Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Cj3aOSI1w).

- **Drill** your listening with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcNEyC98nw).

- **Train** tone pair recognition with [this tone trainer](https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/toneTrainer).

##### Tones are hard

You don't have to perfect at hearing tones straight away. In fact, achieving a full score on the tone pair trainer will be incredibly challenging, and understanding tones in sentences spoken at a full native speed may even feel impossible at first.

This is completely normal.

As long as you are aware of tones and stay mindful of them when listening, all your immersion hours will help bring up your ability to hear them. Don't stress over not being able to hear them perfectly early on. With time, you'll be able to tell them naturally.

##### Pronunciation

If you want extra practice on pronunciation, [this helpful article](https://www.sinosplice.com/learn-chinese/pronunciation-of-mandarin-chinese) goes into a lot of detail about the mouth and tongue placements.

You can check your pronunciation by recording yourself, or ask an advanced learner or native speaker to correct you.

## 2. The next steps

### 2.1 Setting up Anki and Yomitan

The basic tools we will use are a spaced-repetition system called **Anki** and an interactive online look-up dictionary manager called **Yomitan**. Anki uses **Anki decks**, collections of flashcards to help you remember things, and it is usually those decks that will contain the bulk of our language *learning*.

The setup process is technical and can take some time, so it deserves its own section. Head [here](./setup.md) to get started.

### 2.2 Learning Vocabulary

After you've finished setting up Anki and Yomitan, it's time to work through a beginner-level vocabulary deck for Anki. There are a few decks I'd recommend for this purpose.

- [Spoonfed Chinese](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1271086873): A great deck that provides Chinese sentences and their translations, well suited for quickly learning a large amount of vocabulary.
- [Chinese Grammar Wiki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504): You can treat this as a 2-in-1 grammar and sentence deck. I highly recommend this as you both learn a good amount of vocabulary as well as the grammar that goes into the sentences.
- [Refold Decks](https://mega.nz/folder/ql8Via4Y#AS8xY2_zDcPVpDUkct7QsA): Anki decks used by the Refold community.
- [Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1855818143): Classic HSK vocabulary deck.
  
Learning vocabulary takes a long amount of time, do not get discouraged if learning Chinese feels very hard in the beginning. A lot of the difficulty in learning a language like Chinese is front-loaded: Once you learn enough words and hanzi your reading experience gets much smoother. English speakers are usually discouraged at the fact that one requires learning thousands of hanzi to properly read Chinese. But remember:

<div style="text-align:center;"><b>English too requires learning word readings!</b></div>

If you're not convinced, please try to read [this poem](https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~andrew/EAP/PronunciationPoem.pdf). In the first four sentences, we see the digraph *gh* multiple times, and it isn't read the same in every word. Effectively, English also requires learning how written words sound. Tough is not the same as though, yet both words end in *ough*.

### 2.3 Learning Grammar

<!-- // todo! -->

This first step is quite important as it will set you up for success once you start consuming a lot of native content. Some people believe you should start immersing from day one, but personally I think it's better to spend your first few weeks learning basic vocabulary and going through a basic grammar guide. But first, a few remarks:

1. You do not need to have memorized the entirety of the grammar resource you're using to move on.
2. You do not need to have finished your vocabulary deck to start immersing, do so whenever you feel the time is right.
3. Grammar is best understood in context, i.e. in immersion, but it is still worth it to learn some grammar before you start, if anything just to know what is out there (priming) .
4. Most grammar resources are flawed in some way, so if something doesn't make sense, take a look at other grammar resources to see how they present the point that is causing you trouble.

With this out of the way, let's see what grammar resources I recommend.

The grammar guide I like the most is [Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/). It is a very good and structured guide and explains the concepts in a very easy-to-understand and readable way. It is also the de-facto grammar guide that most people use to learn Chinese.

## 3. Immersion and output

### 3.1 Consuming native content

If you're done with a core Anki deck (or well on your way) and you have some grammar under your belt, give yourself a pat on the back. You probably feel like you still don't know any Chinese. That's normal. You haven't really acquired much Chinese yet, but you have learned a good deal. It is now time to start the real journey. This step never technically ends as you will hopefully keep consuming Chinese content as you get better and better at the language. The main aspect of this section is to setup a mining deck. A mining deck is an Anki deck you create yourself using Yomitan on content that you read (or potentially watch with subtitles) where you "mine" words from sentences you see in the wild.

Creating a mining deck is a topic that deserves a thorough explanation and this task is undertaken on the [mining page - COMING SOON](#). I also recommend you start listening to Chinese actively as soon as you can. As said previously, media recommendations can be found on this page. Find a medium you like, be it dramas, donghua or Chinese TV and start listening. Do not be surprised if your ability to listen is wildly inferior to your ability to read at first. When reading you have a written support you can look at any time. Hanzi provide some meaning and help you read. If possible, try to find native speakers to output with. It's fun and motivating.

At this stage of the journey, it would still be useful to consult [your trusty resource](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) for advanced grammar. The way I would study grammar is by doing the following:

1. Come across a sentence using unfamiliar grammar in your reading.
2. Look up the grammar in the master reference.
3. Note down the grammar item you have encountered in a list somewhere.
4. Review it from time to time.

The [grammar deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504) also helps out a lot.

### 3.2 More talking and writing to Chinese natives

Once you have a good grasp of the language and can read more comfortably, it's a great idea to start speaking with natives often. Likewise, I recommend you start writing in Chinese (not necessarily physically of course) and have people correct you. This is not to say you cannot start output much earlier. If you have the opportunity to output earlier, do it and try to get corrected as often as possible, because getting good at reading is not enough to get good at writing, and likewise getting good at listening is not enough to get good at speaking. You need to actually produce (what we call output) and work in the language with others.

### 3.3 On the topic of writing hanzi

*Coming soon*

## 4. The next steps

Whatever you want. Go take the HSK6,7,8,9 if you'd like, it's a nice achievement and you get recognized for your efforts. Learn Cantonese, Hokkien or any other Chinese language you're interested in. Tour in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China. You are now free to do whatever you want and enjoy the language in ways you would have never imagined. Here be dragons!

## Checklist

Here's a simple checklist of things you should do, in order:

- [ ] Learn the sounds.
- [ ] Drill the tones.
- [ ] Setup Anki and Yomitan properly, including a mining deck.
- [ ] Finish a first vocabulary deck and grammar resource.
- [ ] Get input and mine from Chinese content and try to get output with natives.
- [ ] If desired, learn how to write.

## Addendum

### Pinyin vs. Zhuyin

Pinyin and Zhuyin are phonetic writing systems (systems used to represent Chinese words phonetically). See this chart below which shows the differences (Zhuyin is the symbols on the left, Pinyin is the letters on the right):

*COMING SOON*

<!-- ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09cfadbb-ec92-4f30-ac31-aece0bb8558a/bc60e06f-e1bc-409c-ace4-7d9278dde3f2/Untitled.png) -->

If you don’t know how a character is pronounced, you can look at the corresponding Pinyin or Zhuyin (these are called the character’s *readings)* to find out. 

Learn Pinyin if you want to learn mainland Chinese Mandarin. Learn Zhuyin if you want to learn Taiwanese Mandarin. If you don’t have a very strong preference for Zhuyin, learn Pinyin. Most learner resources (such as graded readers and the Language Reactor extension) use pinyin.
