# Guide

Below is a simple roadmap for learning Chinese effectively. Each step, I explain what you should focus on to progress to the next stage. 

All the steps outlined work towards immersion. While this will be the final and longest step of your journey, it should be most fun as you will be using Chinese to consume the media you love.

## 1 The beginnings

### 1.1 Learning the sounds

The very first thing you should do is to learn Pinyin. Pinyin is a system used for spelling out Chinese sounds which uses the letters of the English alphabet that you are already familiar with. Practice by shadowing this Pinyin chart.

#### Pinyin quick tips

- The finals ui, un, and iu are contractions of uei, uen, and iou respectively. They pronounce the exact same.
- The letter ū is written as u when following j, q, x, or y.
- i represents three distinct sounds depending on the initial that precedes it. When it follows z, c, s, it sounds like "zz". When it follows zh, ch, sh, and r, it sounds like "rr". In other cases, it sounds like the English "ee".
- The 'an' in tian and yuan sounds like the English "yen".

## Addendum

### Pinyin vs. Zhuyin

Pinyin and Zhuyin are phonetic writing systems (systems used to represent Chinese words phonetically). See this chart below which shows the differences (Zhuyin is the symbols on the left, Pinyin is the letters on the right):

If you don’t know how a character is pronounced, you can look at the corresponding Pinyin or Zhuyin (these are called the character’s *readings)* to find out. 

Learn Pinyin if you want to learn mainland Chinese Mandarin. Learn Zhuyin if you want to learn Taiwanese Mandarin. If you don’t have a very strong preference for Zhuyin, learn Pinyin. Most learner resources (such as graded readers and the Language Reactor extension) use pinyin.
