# Guide

Below is a simple roadmap for learning Chinese effectively. Each step, I explain what you should focus on to progress to the next stage. 

All the steps outlined work towards immersion. While this will be the final and longest step of your journey, it should be most fun as you will be using Chinese to consume the media you love.

## 1 The beginnings

### 1.1 Learning the sounds

!!! note "Pinyin vs. Zhuyin"
    If you are learning Taiwanese Mandarin, you might be looking to learn Zhuyin instead. However, since Pinyin is more common, this material will only cover it. If you're curious about the differences between Pinyin and Zhuyin, [see the addendum below](#pinyin-vs-zhuyin).

The very first thing you should do is to learn Pinyin. Pinyin is a system used for spelling out Chinese sounds which uses the letters of the English alphabet that you are already familiar with. Practice by shadowing this Pinyin chart.

#### Quick tips

- The letter *ū* is written as *u* when following *j*, *q*, *x*, or *y*.
- The finals *ui*, *un*, and *iu* are contractions of *uei*, *uen*, and *iou* respectively. They pronounce the exact same.
- *i* represents three distinct sounds depending on the initial that precedes it. When it follows *z*, *c*, *s*, it sounds like **zz**. When it follows *zh*, *ch*, *sh*, and *r*, it sounds like **rr**. In other cases, it sounds like the English **ee**.
- The *an* in *'tian'* and *yuan* sounds like the English **yen**.

### 1.2 Drill the tones

In Mandarin there are 4 tones (plus the neutral tone). Tone is a feature of the language where the pitch you use to pronounce a syllable changes the meaning of that syllable. For example, 妈 is pronounced with the first tone as mā and means “mother”, 麻 is pronounced with the second tone as má and means “hemp”, 马 is pronounced using the third tone as mǎ and means “horse”, 骂 is pronounced using the fourth tone as mà and means “scold”, 吗 is pronounced using the neutral tone as ma and is a grammatical particle used to ask questions. See this video for a demonstration of the different tones.

Yes, you have to learn them. You sometimes will hear foreigners who claim that “you don’t have to learn tones because people will understand you based on the context.” At times, this is true — even if you use the wrong tone, people might still understand you. At other times, this is not true and you will not be understood. It is suggested you do not listen to people who tell you that tones aren’t important or that you can just ignore tones. 9 times out of 10 these people have poor Mandarin language abilities themselves. Sometimes you’ll hear natives say that tones aren’t important as well, but they’re just trying to be polite/encouraging to Chinese learners by saying this, and it’s not always good to take language learning advice from native speakers. Tones are a core part of the language.

Learn the tones and basics of tone pairs:

- Practice tone pair recognition: https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/toneTrainer (practice)

You don’t have to be perfect at hearing tones as a beginner. Getting a perfect score on the tone pair quizzes will be extremely hard. Hearing tones in sentences spoken at full native speed will feel impossible. This is all normal. As long as you internalize that tones are an important and necessary part of knowing a word, all of your listening hours will be time spent improving your ability to hear tones. Don’t beat yourself up about your inability to hear them perfectly early on. Eventually, they will sound completely natural.

## Addendum

### Pinyin vs. Zhuyin

Pinyin and Zhuyin are phonetic writing systems (systems used to represent Chinese words phonetically). See this chart below which shows the differences (Zhuyin is the symbols on the left, Pinyin is the letters on the right):

If you don’t know how a character is pronounced, you can look at the corresponding Pinyin or Zhuyin (these are called the character’s *readings)* to find out. 

Learn Pinyin if you want to learn mainland Chinese Mandarin. Learn Zhuyin if you want to learn Taiwanese Mandarin. If you don’t have a very strong preference for Zhuyin, learn Pinyin. Most learner resources (such as graded readers and the Language Reactor extension) use pinyin.
