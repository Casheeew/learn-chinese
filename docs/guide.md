# Guide

Below is a simple roadmap for learning Chinese effectively. Each step, I explain what you should focus on to progress to the next stage.

All the steps outlined work towards immersion. While this will be the final and longest step of your journey, it should be most fun as you will be using Chinese to consume the media you love.

## 1 The beginnings

### 1.1 Learning the sounds

!!! note "Pinyin vs. Zhuyin"
    If you are learning Taiwanese Mandarin, you might be looking to learn Zhuyin instead. However, since Pinyin is more common, this material will only cover it. If you're curious about the differences between Pinyin and Zhuyin, [see the addendum below](#pinyin-vs-zhuyin).

The very first thing you should do is to learn Pinyin. Pinyin (拼音) is a system used for spelling out Chinese sounds which uses the letters of the English alphabet that you are already familiar with. Practice by shadowing this Pinyin chart[^1].

[^1]: If you are a linguistics student or otherwise can read the IPA, you may also find following the [Standard Chinese phonology wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology) to be helpful when learning the sounds of Mandarin.

#### [Pinyin chart (click me!)](https://yoyochinese.com/chinese-learning-tools/Mandarin-Chinese-pronunciation-lesson/pinyin-chart-table)

#### Quick tips

!!! note "Spelling rules"

    - When a syllable starts with *i*, replace *i* with *y* (*ya*, *ye*, *yao*). The exceptions are *yi*, *yin*, *ying* for *i*, *in*, *ing* and *you* for *iu*.
    - When a syllable starts with *u*, replace *u* with *w* (*wu*, *wan*, *wei*).
    - The letter *ü* is written as *u* when following *j*, *q*, *x*, or *y* (*ju*, *qu*, *xu*, *yu*).
    - The finals *ui*, *un*, and *iu* are contractions of *uei*, *uen*, and *iou*. They pronounce the exact same.
    - *ueng* is written as *ong* if preceded by an initial (*tong*, *dong*, *long*).

##### Pronunciation tips

<small>cf. [_i_ with easy components](https://www.chinesepod.com/tools/pronunciation/section/8), [_i_ with _z_, _c_, _s_, _zh_, _ch_, _sh_, _r_](https://www.chinesepod.com/tools/pronunciation/section/9), [sinosplice's pronunciation guide](https://www.sinosplice.com/learn-chinese/pronunciation-of-mandarin-chinese/2), [Refold's pinyin tips](https://zenith-raincoat-5cf.notion.site/Mandarin-Guide-82734307494a429c9ccf0b98e1d8a80c?pvs=25#eee2789bc56241d992ed97858fbc3017)</small>

- _i_ represents three distinct sounds depending on the initial that precedes it.
  - When it follows _z_, _c_, _s_, it sounds like **zz**.
  - When it follows _zh_, _ch_, _sh_, and _r_, it sounds like **rr**.
  - In other cases, it sounds like the English **ee** (in the word _see_).
- The _an_ in _tian_ and _yuan_ sounds like the English **yen** (the Japanese currency).

A good alternative that I highly recommend is following the [Chinese Pronunciation Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Main_Page). It is a really good resource that I personally used, and I suggest going through all the articles at least once.

### 1.2 Drill the tones

Mandarin is a **tonal language**. This means that the **tone**—the rise and fall of your pitch during pronunciation of a syllable—can completely change the word's meaning.

There are 4 main tones in Mandarin, plus a neutral tone:

1. First tone – High and flat (e.g., 妈 _mā_ – "mother")
2. Second tone – Rising, like asking a question in English (e.g., 麻 _má_ – "hemp")
3. Third tone – Dips down and then rises (e.g., 马 _mǎ_ – "horse")
4. Fourth tone – Falling (e.g., 骂 _mà_ – "scold")
5. Neutral tone – Light and unstressed (e.g., 吗 _ma_ – a grammatical particle for questions)

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MkRL33bIc8&t=6s) for a quick demonstration of tones. Be sure to read [this article](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Four_tones) for a really good explanation of tones.

##### Are tones optional?

No, tones are not optional. You must learn them to understand Mandarin speech. Tones are a fundamental feature of the language.
Sometimes, you may hear claims such as "even if you speak tones incorrectly, people will still understand you from context". While this is occasionally true, many other times you will just not be understood.

While tempting to skip, having a good foundation early on will immensely help out in your immersion journey.

##### Practice

- **Learn** the tones through [this excellent video from Grace Mandarin Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Cj3aOSI1w).

- **Drill** your listening with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcNEyC98nw).

- **Train** tone pair recognition with [this tone trainer](https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/toneTrainer).

Try to speak along so you understand how to produce the sounds. Active practice will help you internalize these tones and your pronunciation.

##### Tonal combos

When some combinations of tones are placed next to each other, the individual tones may change.

1. When a third tone (e.g., 你 _nǐ_) is followed by another third tone (e.g., 好 _hǎo_), the first one changes to second tone (你好 _níhǎo_).
2. When 不 (_bù_) is followed by a fourth tone (e.g., 对 _duì_), it changes to second tone (不对 _búduì_).
3. When 一 (_yī_) is followed by a fourth tone (e.g., 个 _gè_), it changes to second tone (一个 _yígè_). When followed by any other tone (e.g., 天 _tiān_), it changes to fourth tone (一天 _yìtiān_).

Note that we do not normally write the tone change. I'm just doing it here for demonstration.

##### Tones are hard

You don't have to become perfect at hearing tones straight away. In fact, achieving a good score on the tone pair trainer on its own will already feel challenging, let alone understanding tones in sentences spoken at full speed. At first, it might feel like you aren't making much progress, but don't worry—this is completely normal.

Tones are tricky, and they take time to master. Don't stress over not being able to hear them perfectly in the beginning. As long as you are aware of tones and stay mindful of them when listening, all your immersion hours will help bring up your ability to hear them. With consistent practice and exposure, you'll be able to tell them naturally.

I highly suggest that you put a good amount of time into listening practice from the start. A lot of people struggle in recalling vocabulary precisely because they don't have good tone recognition. Being adept at tones early on will help you notice them during mining sessions and Anki reviews and make your immersion much more meaningful.

##### Pronunciation

If you want extra practice on pronunciation, [this helpful article](https://www.sinosplice.com/learn-chinese/pronunciation-of-mandarin-chinese) goes into a lot of detail about the mouth and tongue placements.

You can check your pronunciation by recording yourself, or ask an advanced learner or native speaker to correct you.

## 2. The next steps

### 2.1 Setting up Anki and Yomitan

Our primary tools will be **Anki**, a spaced-repetition flashcard program and **Yomitan**, an interactive pop-up dictionary browser extension.

The bulk of our learning will rely on these two tools. Yomitan will help you _learn_ new words as you encounter them during immersion. Anki will help you _review_ and retain these words over time.

The setup process is technical and can take some time, so it deserves its own section. Head [here](./setup.md) to get started.

### 2.2 Learning Vocabulary

// todo! 汉字的构造

After you've finished setting up Anki and Yomitan, it's time to work through a beginner-level vocabulary deck for Anki. There are a few decks I'd recommend for this purpose.

- [Spoonfed Chinese](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1271086873): A great deck that provides Chinese sentences and their translations, well suited for quickly learning a large amount of vocabulary.
- [Chinese Grammar Wiki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504): You can treat this as a 2-in-1 grammar and sentence deck. I highly recommend this as you both learn a good amount of vocabulary as well as the grammar that goes into the sentences.
- [Refold Decks](https://mega.nz/folder/ql8Via4Y#AS8xY2_zDcPVpDUkct7QsA): Anki decks used by the Refold community.
- [Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1855818143): Classic HSK vocabulary deck.

Think of learning vocabulary like a video game. The beginning is a grind—there’s no way around it. However, once you've unlocked enough words and hanzi, everything starts to click. Reading will become a breeze, and you'll sometimes even be able to guess the meanings of new words based on the characters you already know.

### 2.3 Learning Grammar

Mandarin is an analytic[^2] language. This means that it relies on word order and particles instead of the usual conjugations to convey grammatical information. For this reason, Chinese grammar will probably feel _very_ different from the languages you're familiar with. However, since Mandarin doesn’t change word forms and instead relies on particles and sentence structure, you can approach these elements much like vocabulary—looking up via Yomitan and reviewing in Anki.

For a quick demonstration,

If someone asks:

- Have you eaten?

in English, you might respond with:

- I already ate.

In Mandarin, you would say:

- 我吃饭了 (Wǒ chī fàn le).

Here, 了 (le) is a particle that helps indicate a completed action, rather than a verb conjugation (_ate_) like in English. You can easily look up this article using Yomitan as well as add it to Anki.

To first get a good idea of Chinese grammar, I recommend **quickly skimming through the A1 articles** on the [Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/). You don’t need to memorize them—just get a general sense of how grammar works. The real learning happens through immersion. As you encounter grammar in context, you’ll naturally internalize it.

Treat grammar like vocabulary: when you see an unfamiliar particle, look it up with Yomitan to find the most relevant definition. Then, add it to Anki with the context surrounding it to reinforce your understanding. If you're still unsure, revisit the relevant article in the grammar guide.

At this stage, reading the guide is still beneficial, as it explains very well how different particles combine and their distinctions. Over time, as you repeatedly see these structures in real-world contexts, their meanings and usage will become second nature.

[^2]: See the [grammar section of the Wikipedia article for Mandarin Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese#Grammar).

## 3. Immersion and output

### 3.1 Consuming native content

If you're done with a core Anki deck (or well on your way) and you have some grammar under your belt, give yourself a pat on the back. You probably feel like you still don't know any Chinese. That's normal. You haven't really acquired much Chinese yet, but you have learned a good deal. It is now time to start the real journey. This step never technically ends as you will hopefully keep consuming Chinese content as you get better and better at the language. The main aspect of this section is to setup a mining deck. A mining deck is an Anki deck you create yourself using Yomitan on content that you read (or potentially watch with subtitles) where you "mine" words from sentences you see in the wild.

Creating a mining deck is a topic that deserves a thorough explanation and this task is undertaken on the [mining page - COMING SOON](#). I also recommend you start listening to Chinese actively as soon as you can. As said previously, media recommendations can be found on this page. Find a medium you like, be it dramas, donghua or Chinese TV and start listening. Do not be surprised if your ability to listen is wildly inferior to your ability to read at first. When reading you have a written support you can look at any time. Hanzi provide some meaning and help you read. If possible, try to find native speakers to output with. It's fun and motivating.

At this stage of the journey, it would still be useful to consult [your trusty resource](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) for advanced grammar. The way I would study grammar is by doing the following:

1. Come across a sentence using unfamiliar grammar in your reading.
2. Look up the grammar in the master reference.
3. Note down the grammar item you have encountered in a list somewhere.
4. Review it from time to time.

The [grammar deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504) also helps out a lot.

### 3.2 More talking and writing to Chinese natives

Once you have a good grasp of the language and can read more comfortably, it's a great idea to start speaking with natives often. Likewise, I recommend you start writing in Chinese (not necessarily physically of course) and have people correct you. This is not to say you cannot start output much earlier. If you have the opportunity to output earlier, do it and try to get corrected as often as possible, because getting good at reading is not enough to get good at writing, and likewise getting good at listening is not enough to get good at speaking. You need to actually produce (what we call output) and work in the language with others.

## 4. The next steps

Whatever you want. Go take the HSK6,7,8,9 if you'd like, it's a nice achievement and you get recognized for your efforts. Learn Cantonese, Hokkien or any other Chinese language you're interested in. Tour in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China. You are now free to do whatever you want and enjoy the language in ways you would have never imagined. Here be dragons!

## Checklist

Here's a simple checklist of things you should do, in order:

- [ ] Learn the sounds.
- [ ] Drill the tones.
- [ ] Setup Anki and Yomitan properly, including a mining deck.
- [ ] Finish a first vocabulary deck and grammar resource.
- [ ] Get input and mine from Chinese content and try to get output with natives.
- [ ] If desired, learn how to write.

## Addendum

### Pinyin vs. Zhuyin

Pinyin and Zhuyin are phonetic writing systems (systems used to represent Chinese words phonetically). See this chart below which shows the differences (Zhuyin is the symbols on the left, Pinyin is the letters on the right):

_COMING SOON_

<!-- ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09cfadbb-ec92-4f30-ac31-aece0bb8558a/bc60e06f-e1bc-409c-ace4-7d9278dde3f2/Untitled.png) -->

If you don’t know how a character is pronounced, you can look at the corresponding Pinyin or Zhuyin (these are called the character’s _readings)_ to find out.

Learn Pinyin if you want to learn mainland Chinese Mandarin. Learn Zhuyin if you want to learn Taiwanese Mandarin. If you don’t have a very strong preference for Zhuyin, learn Pinyin. Most learner resources (such as graded readers and the Language Reactor extension) use pinyin.

### Pronunciation in use

#### Tones in fast speech

You might sometimes feel that tones, when spoken at full speed, sound a bit different from when spoken deliberately or in isolation. In fact, even when tones are muddled a little bit while speaking to make pronunciation easier, the difference between each tone is still maintained. However in actual speech, the rising part of the third tone is often less prominent, making it sound more like a low, creaky vocal fry.

#### Mandarin varieties

Although one could argue that it’s best to avoid Southern dialects due to their lack of certain sounds—such as the retroflex _sh_ and _zh_ as well as the distinction between _n_ and _l_—many English speakers still prefer the southern pronunciation because it is easier to learn, with fewer sounds to master. In the end, the choice is yours.
